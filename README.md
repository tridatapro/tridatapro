Hello! Welcome to my GitHub account. I'm passionate about data analysis and visualization, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge by diving into A/B testing through a data analytics bootcamp. I'm eager to collaborate with individuals and organizations that share my enthusiasm for leveraging data to gain insights into customer behavior, identify trends, and make informed, data-driven decisions. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email. Let's connect and explore the exciting possibilities of data analysis together!
